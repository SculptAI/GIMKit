# Guided Infilling Modeling

## Design Philosophy

- Stable over feature: We are confident this tool will be widely adopted in downstream applications, so we must ensure its ease of use.  
- Open-source model first: APIs offer limited control over the decoding process, so we prefer open-source models.  
- Small model first: Smaller models can run on a broader range of devices and thus generate wider impact; therefore, we favor smaller models.  
- vLLM first: SGLang is also excellent, but we initially chose vLLM. Additionally, vLLM has a larger user base.
